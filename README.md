#### Chat GPT
ChatGPT: an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text, answering questions, and writing code. ChatGPT was used to generate the code for this Connect Four game.

#### TypeScript
TypeScript is a statically typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds features such as classes, interfaces, and type annotations to JavaScript and can be used to write scalable and maintainable applications. TypeScript was used to develop the game logic and render the game board on the web page.

#### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the game board and provide the user interface.

#### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to style the HTML elements of the game board, such as colors and size of the cells and rows.

#### DOM manipulation
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. DOM manipulation is the process of changing or manipulating the elements of a web page using JavaScript. In this game, DOM manipulation was used to dynamically render the game board and update it after each move.


#### Other Tools
This game was assembled and tested on [Virtual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


Google Chrome and its developer tools was used to test and render the game during production.
